## This file contains the most common config options that a user might want
## to customize.  The values are the same as in mpas_analysis/config.default,
## the default config file, which has all possible configuration options.
## Usage:
##  1. Copy this file to a new name for a specific run (say config.myrun).
##  2. Modify any config options you want to change in your new config file.
##     At a minimum, you need to specify:
##       * [runs]/mainRunName -- A name for the run to be included plot titles
##                               and legends
##       * [input]/baseDirectory -- The directory for the simulation results
##                                  to analyze
##       * [input]/mpasMeshName -- The name of the MPAS ocean/sea ice mesh
##       * [output]/baseDirectory -- The directory for the analysis results
##       * [oceanObservations]/baseDirectory -- The directory for the analysis
##                                              ocean observations
##       * [seaIceObservations]/baseDirectory -- The directory for the analysis
##                                               sea ice observations
##       * [regions]/regionMaskDirectory -- a directory containing MOC and
##                                          ice shelf region masks
##  3. run: mpas_analysis config.myrun.  This will read the configuraiton
##     first from config.default and then replace that configuraiton with any
##     changes from from config.myrun
##  4. If you want to run a subset of the analysis, you can either set the
##     generate option under [output] in your config file or use the
##     --generate flag on the command line.  See the comments for 'generate'
##     in the '[output]' section below for more details on this option.

# preprocessedReferenceRunName is the name of a reference run that has been
# preprocessed to compare against (or None to turn off comparison).  Reference
# runs of this type would have preprocessed results because they were not
# performed with MPAS components (so they cannot be easily ingested by
# MPAS-Analysis)

# config file for a control run to which this run will be compared.  The
# analysis should have already been run to completion once with this config
# file, so that the relevant MPAS climatologies already exist and have been
# remapped to the comparison grid.  Leave this option commented out if no
# control run is desired.
# controlRunConfigFile = /path/to/config/file

# config file for a main run on which the analysis was already run to
# completion.  The relevant MPAS climatologies already exist and have been

# when running "download_analysis_data.py" to get the public observations,
# mapping files and region files.
