# SH_diag
Atmospheric diagnostics package used to facillitate the analysis for the large-scale circlulation 
over the Southern Polar region (NCL). 

#The struction of the diagnostic package:
1. code: the directory saves ncl scripts used by this diagnostic package package 

2. run_script: the directory saves the run scripts to exacuate this diagnostic package, 
               there are two subdirectories
   a. run_script/model_data_process: the shell scripts used to process the monthly-mean climo files used by this package  
   b. run_script/run_polar_diag: the shell scripts used to run the diagnostic package 

2. data: the directory saves the shared data generated by the diagnostic package
 
4. pobs: the directory saves the real observational data to be used by the diagnostic script in this package.
         this is currently underdevelopment 
  
5. work: output figures from this diagnostic package. 


#The diagnostics generate by this package: 
1. The horizonal distribution of selected physical quantities, three sets of the figures are generated:
   a. polar_diag/work/$Casename/Latitude-Longitude_Contour_Maps_20S-90S: horizonal distribution within [20S,90S] polar region   
   b. polar_diag/work/$Casename/Latitude-Longitude_Contour_Maps_55S-90S: horizonal distribution within [55S,90S] polar region   
   c. polar_diag/work/$Casename/Latitude-Longitude_Contour_Maps_Global: horizonal distribution over the globe.   
 
2. Vetical distribution of zonal mean state variables: 
   a. polar_diag/work/$Casename/Pressure-Latitude_Zonal_Mean_Contour/ 

3. EOF analysis to reveal the large-scale circulation modes over the sourthern hemisphere 
   a. polar_diag/work/$Casename/EOF_Mode_Time_Series

4. Regression analysis to reveal the relationships between the large-scale circulation modes and physical quatities 
   a. polar_diag/work/$Casename/Regression_Contour_Maps/

5. Jest position and strength over southern hemisphere
   a. polar_diag/work/$Casename/Jet_Index_Analysis/
 
6. Polar vortex analysis (under development) 
   a. polar_diag/work/$Casename/Polar_Votex/
 

#Planned extensions (by E3SM Cryosphere group) 
1. Weather regime analysis, including blockings, polar vortex.
