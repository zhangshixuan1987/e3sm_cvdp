including 
1. Teleconnections: PNA | WP | NAO | EP/NP | EA/WR | NAO (Jones) | NP | NOI | PDO 
   PNA: Pacific North American Index
   WP: Western Pacific Index 
   NAO: North Atlantic Oscillation 
   NAO (Jones): North Atlantic Oscillation: From CRU
   EP/NP: East Pacific/North Pacific Oscillation
   EA/WR: Eastern Atlantic/Western Russia
   NP: North Pacific Pattern ( area-weighted sea level pressure over the region 30N-65N, 160E-140W. )
   NOI/SOI:The NOI (extratropical-based Northern Oscillation Index) and its analog, the SOI* 
           (extratropical-based Southern Oscillation Index). NOI and the SOI* are computed from 
           NCEP sea level pressure anomalies (SLPA) (monthly sea level pressure minus climatology) 
           of the North Pacific High (NPH) [35N,130W], South Pacific High (SPH) [30S,95W], 
           Darwin [10S,130E], and Tahiti [18S,150W]. The NOI, SOI*, and SOI are created as follows:
            NOI = SLPA_NPH - SLPA_DARWIN
            SOI* = SLPA_SPH - SLPA_DARWIN
            SOI = SLPA_TAHITI - SLPA_DARWIN
           The definitions used to calculate the NOI and SOI* differ slightly from the traditional 
           definition of the SOI (Chelliah 1990), in that neither the pressure series nor the indices 
           are normalized. 
   PDO: Pacific Decadal Oscillation. PDO is the leading PC of monthly SST anomalies in the North Pacific Ocean.
   
2. Atmosphere:      QBO | Global Angular Momentum | SOI | AAO | AO
   QBO: Quasi-Biennial Oscillation Calculated at PSL (from the zonal average of the 30mb zonal wind 
        at the equator as computed from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis).
   SOI: see above 
   Globally Integrated Angular Momentum: Weickmann, K.M., W.A. Robinson and M.C. Penland, 2000: Stochastic and oscillatory forcing of global atmospheric angular momentum. J. Geophys. Res., 105, D12, 15543-15557.
   AO/AAO: Arctic Oscillation/Antarctic Oscillation. The loading pattern of AO (AAO) is defined as the first leading mode from the EOF analysis of monthly mean height anomalies at 1000-hPa (NH) or 700-hPa (SH).Note that year-round monthly mean anomaly data has been used to obtain the loading patterns. Since the AO and AAO have the largest variability during the cold sesaon (variance of AO/AAO), the loading patterns primarily capture characteristics of the cold season patterns.Daily and monthly AO (AAO) indices are constructed by projecting the daily and monthly mean 1000-hPa (700-hPa) height anomalies onto the leading EOF mode. Both time series are normalized by the standard deviation of the monthly index (1979-2000 base period). Since the loading pattern of AO (AAO) is obtained using the monthly mean height anomaly dataset, the index corresponding to each loading pattern becomes one when it is normalized by the standard deviation of the monthly index.
  SAM: The SAM indices and MSLP data are downloaded from https://legacy.bas.ac.uk/met/gjma/sam.html
The caclulation of SAM indicaes are based on the observational data: Marshall, G. J., 2003: Trends in the Southern Annular Mode from observations and reanalyses. J. Clim., 16, 4134-4143, doi:10.1175/1520-0442%282003%29016<4134%3ATITSAM>2.0.CO%3B2

3. ENSO: MEI | Nino 1+2 | Nino 3 | Nino 3.4 | Nino 4 | BEST | Tropical Pacific EOF
   MEI: Multivariate ENSO Index. The bi-monthly Multivariate El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index (MEI.v2) is the time series of the leading combined Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) of five different variables (sea level pressure (SLP), sea surface temperature (SST), zonal and meridional components of the surface wind, and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR)) over the tropical Pacific basin (30°S-30°N and 100°E-70°W).The EOFs are calculated for 12 overlapping bi-monthly "seasons" (Dec-Jan, Jan-Feb, Feb-Mar,..., Nov-Dec) in order to take into account ENSO's seasonality, and reduce effects of higher frequency intraseasonal variability. 
   Nino 1+2: Extreme Eastern Tropical Pacific SST (0-10S, 90W-80W) 
   Nino 3: Eastern Tropical Pacific SST (5N-5S,150W-90W)
   Nino 3.4: East Central Tropical Pacific SST (5N-5S)(170-120W)
   Nino 4: Central Tropical Pacific SST (5N-5S) (160E-150W): 
   BEST: Bivariate ENSO Timeseries. Calculated from combining a standardized SOI and a standardized Niño3.4 SST timeseries.  
   Tropical Pacific EOF: 1st EOF of SST (20N-20S, 120E-60W) 

4. Other SST: ONI | TNI | WHWP | Pacific Warm Pool | MDR | MDRMTROP | TNA | TSA | Atlantic Tripole | 
              Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation | Atlantic Meridional Mode | 
              North Tropical Atlantic Index (NTA) | Caribbean Index (CAR)

   ONI: Oceanic Niño Index. Three month running mean of NOAA ERSST.V5 SST anomalies in the Niño 3.4 region (5N-5S, 120-170W), based on changing base period which onsist of multiple centered 30-year base periods. These 30-year base periods will be used to calculate the anomalies for successive 5-year periods in the historical record.

   TNI: Indices of El Niño Evolution. Calculated at PSL. The timeseries is calculated from the HadISST and the NCEP OI SST Datasets. It is the standardized Nino 12 minus the Niño 4 with a 5 month running mean applied which is then standardized using the 1950-1979 period.

   WHWP: Western Hemisphere Warm Pool. Monthly anomaly of the ocean surface area warmer than 28.5° C in the Atlantic and eastern North Pacific. Based on HadISST and NOAA OI SST (for latest value). Climatology is 1971-2000. Wang, C., and D.B. Enfield, 2001: The tropical Western Hemisphere warm pool, Geophys. Res. Lett., 28, 1635-1638. AOML and PSL

   TNA: Tropical Northern Atlantic Index. Anomaly of the average of the monthly SST from 5.5N to 23.5N and 15W to 57.5W. HadISST and NOAA OI 1x1 datasets are used to create index. Climatology is 1971-2000.

   TSA: Tropical Southern Atlantic Index. Anomaly of the average of the monthly SST from Eq-20S and 10E-30W. HadISST and NOAA OI 1x1 datasets are used to create index. Climatology is 1971-2000.
